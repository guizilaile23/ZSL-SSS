zero shot side scan sonar image classification
code for paper “Zero-shot Side-scan Sonar Images Classification via Synthesis of Pseudo Samples”
the PhtotWCT_4_Sonar dir contain the style transfer method for side scan sonar images, the codes are modify from the original PhotoWCT (https://github.com/NVIDIA/FastPhotoStyle
) 
here their paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06474

the code are writen in pytorch 1.4

and for the classification part, it's a basic classification model, everyone can write one, so there is no need to upload it.
